# TODO
* Add parameter & return descriptions for the part 1 & extra ft functions.


# TODO just before evalling
* Run norminette on all files.
* `norminette $(git ls-tree -r master --name-only)`
* `git ls-tree -r master --name-only`
* Clone this repository.


# TODO after evalling
* Maybe change all *chr to chr[], cause it makes it clearer it's about a string.
* Make functions unprotected that have a ðŸ’¥ emoji in one of their params.
* Use `git push -u github main` to have `git push` push to my private copy of this repo by default.
* Use `git push -v` to see what `git push` pushes to by default.
* Use an alias for "NULL if the allocation fails.", and substitute any variants with it.
* Write basic tests for every function.
* Remove any consts that aren't from vanilla libft.
* Simplify EXTRA_str_not_chr.
* ft_memcmp doesn't pass libftdestructor.
* Maybe rename lstnew to lst_new and such, although this'd also require modifying the testers in testers/.
